Description and Reflection

I changed a little from my original proposal, which is using JavaScript instead of Python. As this one didn't store any data, I don't need to use Python here. All data comes from the form and passing to that api, which is just stored temporarily using "localStorage."

In this project, I will build a responsive HTML package setting a focusing goal and showing how long time you keep focusing and rewards you a visible pokemon you chose. This tool may be of interest to multiple audiences:
1. Students or employees who work remotely and have trouble keeping
focusing at home.
2. People who have phone addiction, digital devices addiction, or can't concentrate on single work on the virtual platform.
3. People who want to build a good habit of focusing and a pokemon lover.

My project will mainly use data from pokemon API( https://pokeapi.co/ ).
This website provides a restful API interface to highly complex objects built from thousands of lines of data related to Pokémon. Using this website, I can consume information on Pokémon images, abilities, and types.

The Javascript front end is composed of 4 parts:
1 homepage(index.html): which creates a root page containing set a new goal button. Once clicked, you are redirected to the goal-setting page.
2 Goal setting page（form.html）: input the goal title, mission time, and expecting Pokemon name. It contains the submit button.
3 Don't give up page（form_final.html ）: It contains the finished button and your goal. Once you finished your goal, click the finish button and be redirected to the congratulation page.
4 Congratulation page (search.html): It will show you the pokemon you input at a goal setting page and displays the name, abilities, and sprite in a pleasing manner.


The primary function is the Ajax function on search.html to call the api. Includes:
1 Passing the name from the previous page to this one
2 iterating the loop of abilities and printing on the front end
3 Using the image from the api.
